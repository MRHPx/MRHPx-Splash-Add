**FEATURE..?**

MRHPx Splash Add supports PE files such as EXE (.exe), DLL (.dll). This program uses some injection technique so it's easy to inserting bitmap into simple packed/compressed executable file eg : UPX, etc.. (perhaps, one day I could add the inline tricks and features)

It's portable, there's no need to install anything.. Just use it,  or delete it when you decided to buy another expensive similar tool :smile:
